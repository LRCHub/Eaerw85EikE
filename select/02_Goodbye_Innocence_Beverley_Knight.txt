Written By Beverley Knight

Goodbye innocence, you didn't stay too long
You were her haven, her solace while she was young
But Fate decreed that fear would form her personality
And she would cry when daylight passed, knowing that the night would bring
...Daddy

Goodbye innocence, you made her happy
Goodbye innocence, you saved her from pain
But you weren't enough, to break the heavy fall
Goodbye
Goodbye innocence

Now a woman, her character's 'unclean'
Childhood haunts her, she's fighting the things unseen
A slave to memory, relived as she sleeps
And freedom like the prisoner, whose fate is sealed by hate
Is a dream

Chorus

If only she found a reason to trust somebody
She would find a friend in me, o yes
See, I can't take away the pain, that she endured no, no, no
But I try to ease her misery

Chorus
