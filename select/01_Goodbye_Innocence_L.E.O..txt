Get up
Ya gotta see the sunshine
It's better in the day time
So just open up your eyes and see it c'mon
Ya gotta lotta life to live
Ya gotta lotta love to give
Even if it's just a buncha new age junk

Goodbye innocence
Tell me when the world stopped makin sense...
...you went away
A rainy cloud has followed me around
So why do you have to go away so soon?

I know
It ain't a bowl of cheerios
We get a little weary-oh
And there's nearly every kind of eery

Go on
I know ya know the way it is
You're gonna have to learn to deal
'Cause there's no such thing as real unless there is

Goodbye innocence
Tell me when the world stopped makin sense...
...you went away
A rainy cloud has followed me around
So why do you have to go away so soon?

Time's such a cunning thief
Steal your dreams
Cause you grief
No sense in crying 'bout tomorrow
Sometimes you just have got to stand there waving

Goodbye innocence
Tell me when the world stopped makin sense...
...you went away
A rainy cloud has followed me around
So why do you have to go away so soon?
